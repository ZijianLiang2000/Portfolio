                    The proposed project is a web application with the aim to improve both mental and physical health of
                    users and for them to build positive daily habits. The project will produce a fully functional online
                    application, which allows users to sign up and join as part of their community. During these challenging
                    times, our schedules and social lives have been hindered due to the nationwide lockdown, thus it is
                    important to have a one-stop website that allows the user to tackle all the repercussions of this. The
                    web application will be comprised of:

                            To have the algorithm functioning within the web application, users should first select or
                            search their current location to be taken into the algorithm and the initial User Daily
                            Questionnaire's location variable after the creation of the sign-up questionnaire. Then the
                            users should input their personal physical data and preferences on relevant features of fitness
                            exercise. These data will generate the Body mass index (BMI) value (based on the BMI formula
                            taking in weight and age parameter), the recommended daily steps (based on the users'
                            athletic level and age parameter). With the original preference scores acquired from the signup form, an initial instance of user daily questionnaire would be generated inheriting those
                            score parameters from the former. These scores will be passed to the recommendation
                            algorithm using content-based filtering and be compared with each activity's own scores in
                            order to calculate and sort the activities with the most similarity scores compared with user
                            scores. The activities with top similarities will then be considered determining on whether the
                            users' local city's weather is applicable for each activity to be held. If not, then those activities
                            would be filtered out from the recommendation list. Eventually, a list of activities would be
                            recommended to users.

                            To bring about the recommendation algorithm to be functional and progressive in a daily
                            basis, the user daily questionnaire becomes the key of achieving the core value of usercentralisation. A dynamic recommendation algorithm should not only take users' initial and
                            momentary preference into consideration, but also extract the continuous shifting habits of
                            the users. When a new day begins, the users are suggested to fill in a specialised user daily
                            questionnaire for that day. With the new form filled in, the new daily preference scores will
                            be brought into algorithm, replacing the scores from the previous day to generate new scores.
                            These new scores would be put into calculation and compared with scores from each activity.
                            Then, new recommended activities list would be generated for the user.

                            The weather API used in the project would be a factor influencing the recommendation
                            algorithm. It is implemented to inquire current weather conditions of a specific city passed
                            36
                            through API query. To achieve this, the team decided on using the OpenWeather API [16]. It
                            provides free subscription on “Current Weather Data” service supporting over 200,000 cities
                            globally. To enable users to input their local city name or search from provided list of options,
                            the “check_weather” view utilises “Select2” gem generating a customizable select box with
                            support for searching. Typical city names in UK are provided as a list for users to select from
                            or searched. To remain this function in a light-weighted manner, the provided city list does
                            not include all 200,000 cities supported by the API. If the user's current city name is not listed
                            inside, they can also directly type in their current city name in the search bar. These
                            operations collaborating with the JavaScript code generate and passe the “location” value to
                            the “show_weather” function in the “user_daily_questionnaire” controller by clicking on
                            “Search” button.
                            The API_Key used for this API is defined as an Environment Variable stored locally. With the
                            “net-http” gem, API request can be sent in the format of the provided syntax taking in city
                            name parameter and API_Key. If the API response is empty, user will be redirected back to
                            the root path or returning to the “check_weather” view to search again depending on current
                            sign-up status. If the API is responding correctly, and the “main” variable in “weather” is
                            returned validated correctly, the city name variable would be passed to the existing user daily
                            questionnaire or the one to be created, which sets the current location for user. With the
                            location being set after signing up, when accessing the daily exercise recommendation view,
                            the controller could determine which activities being enabled or vice versa. This is done
                            according to its conditional statement taking in “location” in user daily questionnaire and
                            inquiring the current weather status of that location to be compared with the corresponding
                            “weather_restricted” Boolean field for each activity instance. So that for an instance, some
                            outdoor activities would be filtered out due to inadequate weather before recommending to
                            users. If the user is willing to switch to a different location, click on the “Change Location” tab
                            on the navigation bar to redirect to the “check_weather” view.

                            The Music API is intended to cooperate with the user preference scores, to recommend suitable
                            playlists for user's current day fitness preference. This is achieved by using the Spotify API. The
                            Spotify API contains an entry to search for playlists according to “category_id”, in which the website
                            can input fixed “category_id” covering each case of user's preference score.

                            • The sprint team needs to apply for Spotify developer account for the website application. After
                            registration the developer applied for a new app project, Spotify would then provide a Client ID and
                            a Client Secret ID for each developer. To access Spotify database, an (temporary) access token is
                            required to respond to developer's request. To do so, developers should access their Spotify
                            credentials and authorize the web app. Then, Spotify requires user to fill in a White-listed address
                            for redirection after authentication. The address is inputted as “https://example.com/callback”. The
                            first attempt was to receive the access token by encoding the URI, our client id and the client secret
                            id in specific formats for requesting type (access) token, which is the Implicit Grants flow approach.
                            Then accessing the new encoded URI would require developers to agree terms and conditions from
                            Spotify. A new URL would appear containing mainly the actual access token, its type and expiry time.
                            Using the token inside the “recommend_playlist” within home controller, to apply for API response
                            with a “category_id” in a rest-client get request would return a list of playlists of this category.
                            %br
                            %br
                            • However, the access token follows OAuth2 guidelines. It is not a permanent key for developers to
                            request API response and is designed to expire every hour four security purpose. In order to access
                            Spotify's API database, it is necessary to dynamically to update the access token every time a user
                            uses the Music API provided, which is the Authorization Code flow approach. To achieve this, another
                            approach has taken place. To get the latest access key, a refresh token is also needed. It is done
                            bymaking a POST request by “HTTParty” to Spotify API's token endpoint with a grand type of
                            “refresh_token” as well as the user client ID and client secret ID. This starts by returning to
                            application of the generated URL code with the encoded redirect URL and client credentials. The
                            starting steps remain the same as previously, but when developers encode the URI, they should not
                            request a “token” but response type as “code” (an authorization code that can be exchanged for an
                            access token). It would not return a token this time, but a code used to request for the access token
                            and a refresh token. Then, access these two fields by making a POST request to the Spotify Accounts
                            service with parameters including client ID, client secret ID, grand_type, authorization code and
                            redirect URI. Eventually, Spotify API would return the refresh token. With this token set as an
                            environment variable, it can be inputted into requesting access token every time users access the
                            controller action.
                            %br
                            %br
                            • As the controller receives an up-to-date access token every time the API request is executed, the
                            website can now normally request for API response by providing entries and variables needed. The
                            endpoint for returning list of playlists according to provided category ID is set, and there are some
                            fixed “category_id” options set to be passed to the controller's API request based on the user's
                            preference score stored in the User Daily Questionnaire (eg: If physicality_score > 3, category_id =
                            ”workout” or “rock”, etc. according to a random shuffle). The returned data can be shuffled and pass
                            one random playlist to recommend user which is suitable for user's activities recommended. The
                            returned JSON data can be transformed into a random track being shuffled and filtered variables
                            include all the playlist's redirect URL, cover image, description, popularity, tracks within the playlist
                            to be shown in the “recommend_playlist” view.
