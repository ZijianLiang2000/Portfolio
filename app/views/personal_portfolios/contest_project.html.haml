                    While technology brings infinite convenience to the world, it increases the burden on the elderly. For this reason, it should be the common pursuit of all financial institutions and even the whole industry to allow the elderly to enjoy the convenience brought by technological progress, and to join the young people on the express train of technology.
                    While developing science and technology, we will promote the popularization of smart devices among the elderly, help them integrate into the information society, enhance their sense of gain, and allow more and more elderly people to overcome the "digital divide" and share the results of informatization development in the financial industry with young people. , providing financial services with higher satisfaction is an important way to help people achieve a better life. 
                    To this end, this product relies on the advantages of ICBC and is designed according to the principle of "suitable for aging", providing a simple and clear mobile client operation interface for the elderly. At the same time, it provides the elderly with personalized, rich, reliable, comprehensive and profitable financial and life services through technologies such as big data (algorithms). By tailoring exclusive wealth products for the elderly, this platform not only brings benefits to ICBC, but also lowers the threshold for wealth management of such customer groups, so as to benefit the elderly customers and promote common prosperity.

                            The base of the elderly population in China translates to a trillion-level industrial market.
                            There are shortcomings in the layout of the traditional financial market for the elderly group, and existing financial products and services do not
                            provide optimal user experience for elderly users. In addition, part-time scams, phishing scams, and financial credit scams are emerging in an endless stream.
                            with the rapid development of big data, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, 5G and other technologies, 
                            banks in the future will inevitably be more intelligent, open, and flexible, and deeply integrated with customer scenarios.
                            Therefore, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China can develop the
                            Combining machines with machines to build a complete financial ecosystem for the elderly

                            The bank relies on a database of older users with key characteristics such as income, urban/rural residence differences, age group, etc., combined with the consumption structure of the user in the database to segment the customers.
                            Its database is capable of classifying and filtering the customers into training, validation and test sets, which are then trained by the deep convolutional neural network in the deep learning model.
                            The deep learning model is trained by a deep convolutional neural network to learn how users are segmented according to their data characteristics.
                            After adjusting the hyperparameters, the pre-training model will cross-validate the predicted classification results with the validation set and back-propagate to adjust the weights of the neurons at each level to reach the lowest loss to converge with the actual training samples.
                            The model is designed to continuously fit the actual classification of the training set. Under ideal parameters, the neural network model's
                            results of the regression coefficients and the residual analysis are all within the ideal or reasonable range.
                            Once the model has been evaluated with these indicators in a more satisfactory
                            it can then be fine-tuned by retraining the original data to improve the accuracy and compatability with fresh user data.

                            When the ML model can successfully classify user characteristics for segmentation purpose, then the bank can build an algorithm to recommend suitable financial composite products to new users. In this way, their demands in terms of investment, savings and consumptions can be combined with 
                            their real-life financial and other conditions, can be met with customised products being advertised. After subdividing elderly users, they can launch corresponding savings, consumption and investment needs and habits that meet their needs according to each subdivision structure. Financial solutions (including but not limited to asset allocation suggestions, screened insurance products, wealth management products, etc., as well as financial product configuration packages customized for users after statistics and analysis), help banks achieve precision marketing and help customers efficiently Find financial products that meet your needs and achieve effective and safe asset appreciation.
                            In addition, customers can also obtain corresponding coupons under the scenarios of ICBC's credit level, deposit limit, and points, and reduce or deduct transaction fees accordingly, so as to reduce the outflow of users with wealth management needs to other investments. platform.

                            On the whole, existing aging-friendly apps do not really take into account the needs of the elderly, but apply more of a simple "font enlargement‚Äù for their elderly mode. Existing problems such as the unchanged second pages and menus, hidden entries, complicated interactions, and the immense amount of ads led those old-fashioned APPs on the market not able to well meet the needs of the elderly.

                            As a result, this product focuses on the core concept of serving elderly users. At the beginning of the design, it focused on enriching functions, in a concise and clear way, including large fonts, large icons, high contrast, simple functions, no ads and no bullets. A large number of one-key operations, one-key call/help, video explanation, text input prompts and other accessibility functions are optimized for the page and operation logic. Its operation logic and screen interaction design are adaptable and friendly to elderly users.

                            This product displays more functions clearly and concisely under the same menu as much as possible by reducing the frequency of menus above the secondary level in the operation logic. The first-level menu is an intuitive display of common functions for all elderly users, and users can move, shrink, and zoom in at this level. The focused icon in the center of the screen and the icon in the shape of a "one" around it will display the name of the function, and the rest of the icons will be presented in a smaller and smaller size. This product uses zooming as the operation mode for entering/exiting the page. Zooming in or clicking on any icon will gradually enter the secondary menu of the application or function, and the icons listed are the basic operation options of the function. The progressive presentation of animation between picture transitions can theoretically prevent the elderly from reducing cognitive overload caused by mental processing speed.
                            The product interface in default is adapted to larger-sized icons and corresponding font size and thickness. Elderly users can adjust them in the settings according to their own conditions. Due to the weakening of the elderly's visual, auditory, learning and operating abilities, and memory, this product not only emphasizes the adaptation and optimization of the above aspects for elderly users, but also adds vibration feedback for tactile stimulation. All icons feature clean designs in large, high-contrast colorways. The font is in large and in unlined boldface. Due to the design with fewer menu levels, the navigation bar is relatively simple, and in most scenarios, there are buttons for "return to the main menu" and "return to the previous level".

A clear "Help" icon button is set in the upper right corner of the main and secondary interfaces. Click to provide "Dynamic Demonstration Guidance" and "Remote Assistance". Among them, the "Dynamic Demonstration Guide" is the direct animation/video demonstration of each basic operation, including the operation guide and description of the interaction logic and detailed steps of each function. In the "remote assistance" option, you can choose to use the supporting APP to assist relatives or the bank's professional customer service staff to access and operate information or scenarios that do not involve personal privacy and the bank with the user's consent.
